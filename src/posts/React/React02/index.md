This will open your app in a new browser window at http://localhost:3000.

6. Start coding! Open the `src/App.js` file to start building your React app.

Create React App provides a lot of out-of-the-box features, such as hot module reloading, linting, and optimized production builds, so you can focus on writing your code instead of configuring your build environment. Happy coding!
